  <p>Experienced Ag Science Teacher with a demonstrated history of working in the primary/secondary education industry. Skilled in Reproduction, Laboratory Skills, Genetics, and Science. Strong professional with a Masters of Science (M.S) focused in Animal Science, Reproductive Physiology from Texas Tech University.</p>
  <p>Growing up on a working cattle ranch in Central Texas I learned from an early age how important agriculture meant to the very existence of the human race. Therefore, agriculture has always been a major part of my life. Throughout my youth I was very active in FFA. I showed a variety of different species (primarily steers and heifers), judged livestock, and participated in multiple leadership development events. However, the most fascinating privilege of agriculture has always been to experience the miracle of life with each and every new baby born.</p>
